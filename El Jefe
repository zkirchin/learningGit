This will cause a merge conflict!
He had to go away. 


Oooh

We're no strangers to love
Jeff knows the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
Jeff wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell Jeff how I'm feeling
Gotta make Jeff understand

Never gonna give Jeff up
Never gonna let Jeff down
Never gonna run around and desert Jeff
Never gonna make Jeff cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt Jeff

We've known each other for so long
Jeffr heart's been aching, but Jeff're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if Jeff ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me Jeff're too blind to see

Never gonna give Jeff up
Never gonna let Jeff down
Never gonna run around and desert Jeff
Never gonna make Jeff cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt Jeff

Never gonna give Jeff up
Never gonna let Jeff down
Never gonna run around and desert Jeff
Never gonna make Jeff cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt Jeff

(Ooh, give Jeff up)
(Ooh, give Jeff up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give Jeff up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give Jeff up)

We've known each other for so long
